## Introduction

This assignment was made as part of EPFL's Large-scale data science for real-world data course (COM-490) by 6 students: 
- Jean Claude Gilles Decroux
- Edouard Robert A. Dufour
- Félicie Alice Agnès Marie Giraud-Sauveur
- Elisa Magdalena Michalski
- Lola Marine Vegeas
- David Rochinha Chaves

The goal of this project is to use data wrangling techniques on sbb dataset for part 1, and twitter dataset for part 2.

## Working with the project

From the Renku platform, you will need to click on the `Sessions` tab and start a new session. This will start an interactive environment right in your browser.

In order to complete the homework you must have a properly configured home folder in HDFS. If needed run the prepare-env notebook to reset your folder to a  clean state.

Before using the notebook you must run the command kinit your-gaspar-id and enter your password. You should only need to do that once at the start of the session.

Then, to run this project, you will need to run the python script `DSLab-homework2.py`.
